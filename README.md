# Monitoring-Motion

## Project Overview
This is my contribution to the 2025 NFL Data Bowl Kaggle competition. The goal of the competition was to conduct a prediction analysis using NFL play and player tracking data from weeks 1-9 of the 2021 season to predict.
I aim to predict receiver routes on motion plays by using clustering and predictive techniques.
